                        as water harvesting, to reuse the water consumed in our Paint Plant. Through these efforts, we
                        have successfully reduced our annual water consumption from 2.70 million liters to a mere 0.13
                        million liters. This significant reduction conserves water and ensures its availability to the
                        communities in the surrounding areas.</p>

                        plan to contribute to this cause. As part of this plan, we are dedicated to substantially
                        increasing our Water Recycling capacity, which is currently at 5%. By implementing advanced
                        recycling techniques, we aim to further reduce our water footprint and positively impact the

                        pollution. Burning crop residues releases a staggering number of harmful emissions into the
                        atmosphere. To put it into perspective, this practice results in the release of 149.24 million
                        tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), over 9 million tons of carbon monoxide (CO), 0.25 million tonnes
                        of sulphur oxides (SOX), 1.28 million tonnes of particulate matter, and 0.07 million tonnes of
                        black carbon. These emissions contribute to air pollution and have far-reaching consequences,
                        such as the haze in Delhi and the melting of Himalayan glaciers.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up">At NNE, we recognise the urgent need to combat this environmental challenge. That’s why we are
                        committed to leveraging renewable and sustainable resources to reduce our carbon footprint.
                        Currently, we operate on 35% solar energy, and our goal is to increase it to 50% in the near
                        future. Renewable energy solutions are continuously advancing, becoming more cost-effective,
                        reliable, and efficient. We must shift away from our reliance on fossil fuels, which are
                        detrimental to the planet and its ecosystems.</p>
